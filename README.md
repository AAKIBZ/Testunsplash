# unsplash_demo_nova by aakib jabbar

#this application is made for a test and accordingly the changes have been made there is only one issue 
#that i am currently facing is that i have used the cached image network that caches the images locally but
#there is an issue that api new data when it is called so the previous cached images are of no use and 
#when we call the api again without internet then i recieve null urls so the only way to solve that was 
#using the local database like sqflite or hive  but that would be  a different thing .
#functions have been named so there would be no issues ....
